Horse Race Simulator 

## Description

The Horse Race Simulator is a Java application that simulates a horse race. It provides both textual and graphical interfaces for users to interact with.

## Installation

To run the simulator, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone:  https://github.com/your-username/horse-race-simulator.git

Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files: javac *.java


## Usage

To run the simulator, execute the following command:

java RaceV4

Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the race settings and start the race. Race settings include: number of horses, track length, and individual horse confidence level. 

The higher the confidence level (0.1 - 0.9), the faster the horse will run, but a higher chance the horse will also fall.
